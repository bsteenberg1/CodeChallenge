## Bar Chart:

- **Orientation:** The decision to present the bar chart in a horizontal orientation was made to prevent information overlap and improve readability. This layout allows for clear differentiation between suburbs and facilitates easier comparison.

- **Color Gradient:** The color gradient in the bar chart, from darkest to lightest, serves to visually highlight the descending order of service requests across suburbs. Darker colors represent higher service request counts, providing an intuitive visual cue.

- **Interactivity:** Enabling interactivity by allowing users to click on a bar and view a pie chart enhances the user experience. This feature provides a detailed breakdown of service requests for a selected suburb, aiding in deeper exploration.

## Pie Chart:

- **Visualization Choice:** The pie chart was chosen to represent the composition of service requests in a suburb. It offers a clear and concise way to visualize the distribution of service request types (codes) within a selected area.

- **Code Breakdown:** By displaying the various codes as segments in the pie chart, users can quickly grasp the relative proportion of different service request types. This helps in understanding the predominant issues in a suburb.

## Maps:

- **Cluster Representation:** Using cluster markers on the map provides a convenient way to visualize the density of service requests across different geographic areas. Darker clusters represent a higher concentration of service requests.

- **Color Variation:** The variation in cluster colors, with darker shades indicating higher numbers of service requests, enhances the map's visual hierarchy. This allows users to quickly identify regions with a higher demand for services.

These design choices aim to create an intuitive and informative data visualization experience, facilitating a better understanding of service request patterns across Cape Town. Each element contributes to a cohesive dashboard that enables users to explore and derive insights effectively.
