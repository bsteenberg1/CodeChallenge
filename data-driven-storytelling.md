## Introduction

"In which suburbs should the Water and Sanitation directorate concentrate their infrastructure improvement efforts?"

Water and Sanitation are integral components of our basic needs, representing fundamental services that directly impact the well-being and quality of life for communities. As essential elements of urban infrastructure, the provision of clean water and effective sanitation plays a crucial role in fostering healthy living environments. However, with the ever-growing demands of urbanization, ensuring efficient infrastructure in every neighborhood becomes a challenge. This analysis seeks to answer the question: "In which suburbs should the Water and Sanitation directorate concentrate their infrastructure improvement efforts?" By leveraging data on service requests and visualizations, we aim to guide strategic decisions for targeted infrastructure enhancements in areas that need them the most.

## Data Collection

The dataset utilized for this analysis is a CSV extract containing records of service requests across Cape Town. This extensive dataset, provided by the City of Cape Town, captures hundreds of thousands of service requests, offering valuable insights into the demands and concerns of the local community. The data serves as a rich source of information for understanding the landscape of Water and Sanitation service requests within the Cape Town area.

**Dataset Attributes:**
-	**Service Request ID:** Unique identifier for each service request.

**Dataset Source:**
The dataset was obtained from the City of Cape Town, which aggregates and maintains records of service requests reported by residents. This comprehensive dataset encompasses a diverse range of issues related to water and sanitation, providing a comprehensive overview of the challenges faced by different suburbs.


## Exploration

The initial dataset comprised approximately 941,634 records, representing a comprehensive collection of service requests across Cape Town. To make the analysis more manageable and focused on the Water and Sanitation directorate, a Python script was employed to extract data specifically related to this directorate. Additionally, the script identified and isolated the top ten suburbs with the highest number of service requests, allowing for a more targeted analysis.

**Key Statistics and Trends:**
-	**Total Records:** The original dataset contained around 941,634 records.
-	**Top Ten Suburbs:** The analysis focused on the top ten suburbs with the most service requests.
-	**Directorate Selection:** Data extraction was refined to include only service requests related to the Water and Sanitation directorate.
-	**Suburb Demographics:** Upon exploration, it was observed that the majority of the top ten suburbs with the highest service requests are situated in economically disadvantaged areas.
-	**Service Request Types:** The predominant service request type within these suburbs was related to sewerage problems.

**Patterns and Outliers:**
- **Economic Disparities:** A notable pattern emerged, indicating that service requests were concentrated in suburbs with lower economic indicators.
- **Sewerage Issues:** The majority of service requests were associated with problems related to sewerage systems.
- **Focused Data Extraction:** The decision to focus on the Water and Sanitation directorate allowed for a more targeted analysis aligned with the specific question posed.

These initial observations lay the groundwork for a deeper exploration into the challenges faced by specific suburbs, providing valuable insights for targeted infrastructure improvement efforts.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the analysis of service request data from the City of Cape Town has provided valuable insights into the challenges faced by various suburbs, particularly in the realm of Water and Sanitation services. Here are the key takeaways:
